}

\item{x}{image}

\value{
Data frame with 3J+1 rows.

\description{
Produces an estimate of the multiscale variance with approximate 
confidence intervals using the 2D MODWT.
}
\details{
The wavelet variance is basically the average of the squared wavelet 
coefficients across each scale and direction of an image. As shown 
in Mondal and Percival (2012), the wavelet variance is a 
scale-by-scale decomposition of the variance for a stationary spatial
process, and certain non-stationary spatial processes.
