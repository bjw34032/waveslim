Description: Basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D) 
  and array (3D) analysis.  The code provided here is based on
  wavelet methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000);
  Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-tree complex wavelet
  transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as implemented by
  Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs (Selesnick 2001, 2002).  All
  figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW (2001) are reproducible using this 
  package and R code available at the book website(s) below.
